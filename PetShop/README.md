# Pet Shop

This is a decentralised Pet Shop application. Customers may select a pet of their choie for adoption 
from the gallery. Each customer is entitled to only one pick.

To see the application in action:
1) Install the node.js runtime environment on your system.
2) Use it to install truffle packages.
3) Clone this repo to your system. 
4) In it's main directory, run the command "truffle develop". This will create a private test blockchain using the in-built Ganache client. This window will remain running for the rest of the simulation.
5) Install and activate the MetaMask browser plug-in from Chrome Extensions. This will convert your browser into an injected web3 environment, which is needed to interact with the blockchain.
6) The "truffle develop" command will have produced a set of mnemonics as part of its output. Use these to create your MetaMask client. You will also have to set a password for it.
7) To finally run the application, open its main directory in a new terminal window and run the command "npm run dev".
